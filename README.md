# Cephalon Tobran Trapped in a Web Browser

[![license-badge]][license]

[Cephalon Tobran][cephalon-tobran-org] is dedicated to aiding players of the free-to-play game [Warframe][warframe-referral] find, collect and track the numerous frames, weapons, mods, and other collectibles available in-game.

Disclaimer: the above link is a referral link. I'm not paid, but we both benefit with in-game stuff from using it, if you don't already have an account.

This is the version meant to run in a modern web browser.

I started this project to grow and test my development skills. It's meant for my amusement, for now.

## Feature Roadmap

### Initial Features

- List all collectibles which contribute to Mastery Rank.
- List all mods.
- Allow authenticated users to indicate their personal collection status for each item, from not acquired through to mastered or whatever is appropriate for a particular collectible.
- Indicate how each collectible can be acquired.

### Future Features

- Provide alerts for items which are temporarily available or more easily acquired, such as Baro Ki'teer stock, Gifts of the Lotus and Twitch Drops.
- Track subtasks for collectibles, such as blueprint acquisition, resource gathering, syndicate leveling and Foundry completion.
- List and track other types of collectibles which do no contribute to Mastery Rank or effectiveness, but are collectible non-the-less.
- Display current Warframe Market prices for tradeable items.

## Contributing

At this point, I am not accepting contributions to this project.
