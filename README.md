## Feature Roadmap

### Initial Features

- List all collectibles which contribute to Mastery Rank.
- List all mods.
- Allow authenticated users to indicate their personal collection status for each item, from not acquired through to mastered or whatever is appropriate for a particular collectible.
- Indicate how each collectible can be acquired.

### Future Features

- Provide alerts for items which are temporarily available or more easily acquired, such as Baro Ki'teer stock, Gifts of the Lotus and Twitch Drops.
- Track subtasks for collectibles, such as blueprint acquisition, resource gathering, syndicate leveling and Foundry completion.
- List and track other types of collectibles which do no contribute to Mastery Rank or effectiveness, but are collectible non-the-less.
- Display current Warframe Market prices for tradeable items.

## Contributing

I started this project to grow and test my development skills. It's meant for my amusement, for now.

At this point, I am not really accepting contributions. However, feel free to post an issue if you see something that needs fixing.
